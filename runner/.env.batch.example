# Batch Processing Configuration Example
# Add these to your .env file or docker-compose.yml

# Maximum number of messages to batch together before processing
# Higher values = better throughput, but higher latency for individual messages
# Recommended: 10-20 for normal traffic, 5 for low traffic, 20-50 for high traffic
METRICS_BATCH_SIZE=10

# Maximum time (in seconds) to wait before processing an incomplete batch
# Lower values = lower latency, but potentially less efficient batching
# Recommended: 5.0 for balanced performance, 2.0 for low latency, 10.0 for max efficiency
METRICS_BATCH_TIMEOUT=5.0

# Example configurations for different scenarios:

# Low traffic (few messages, prioritize latency)
# METRICS_BATCH_SIZE=5
# METRICS_BATCH_TIMEOUT=10.0

# Normal traffic (default - balanced)
# METRICS_BATCH_SIZE=10
# METRICS_BATCH_TIMEOUT=5.0

# High traffic (many messages, prioritize throughput)
# METRICS_BATCH_SIZE=20
# METRICS_BATCH_TIMEOUT=2.0

# Very high traffic (optimize for maximum throughput)
# METRICS_BATCH_SIZE=50
# METRICS_BATCH_TIMEOUT=1.0
