- **"Contribution"** means any code, documentation, or other material you intentionally provide to this project via pull request, issue, patch, or any other method.

## 2. License Grant
You grant the project maintainers and the project’s users a **perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free license** to use your Contribution under the **Elastic License 2.0**.

2. You have the right to submit it (for example, employer permission), and

If your employer owns intellectual property you create, you confirm that:
- You have received permission to submit the Contribution on behalf of your employer, and
